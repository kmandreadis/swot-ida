========

SWOT-IDA is a project to collect code of different approaches of estimating river disharge from SWOT observations. 
SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography) would provide global observations of water surface elevation and width. 

There are a number of different approaches of estimating river discharge from these observations:

1) Markov Chain Monte Carlo

2) Manning's equation-based method

3) Levenberg-Marquardt optimization of a steady-state hydraulic model

4) Data assimilation
